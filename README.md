# Exfil
A script inspired by Cold Wars Exfil mechanic.

Every 5 rounds after round 10 you'll be able to exfil to end the game with a fun little challenge.
Exfil will be open for a limited time (similar to Cold Wars duration)

Once exfil has been initiated players will have to race to the escape location while zombies will continue to spawn. If you don't escape within the time frame you will die!

The time frame is made to make it fair for each map. (Tranzit will be the longest compared to Nuketown)

The exfil radio and location will be identified as a Green Revive icon, stay on a look out!

## Installation
Download exfil.gsc and put it in your Plutonium T6 scripts folder

```%localappdata%\Plutonium\storage\t6\scripts\zm\```

(if the folder isnt there create them)


OR you may use the source code/uncompiled version by using exfil_sourcecode.gsc but if you don't know what youre doing in terms of GSC, I highly recommend you use the first choice
