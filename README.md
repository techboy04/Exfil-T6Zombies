# Exfil
A script inspired by Cold Wars Exfil mechanic.

Every 5 rounds after round 10 you'll be able to exfil to end the game with a fun little challenge.
Exfil will be open for a limited time (similar to Cold Wars duration)

Once exfil has been initiated players will have to kill all the zombies and then head to the escape location. If you don't escape within the time frame you will die!

The exfil radio and location will be identified as a Revive icon, stay on a look out!

There are two different versions, the mod version (Recommended for the full experience) and the script only version.

# Using the Mod version (Recommended)
## zm_exfil.zip

## Installation
Download zm_exfil zip and put it in your Plutonium T6 mods folder

```%localappdata%\Plutonium\storage\t6\mods\```

There are configurable options which can be changed via the **Custom Games** menu instead of the console! (You can still do it in the console)
The values also save after you set them so they load when coming back!
