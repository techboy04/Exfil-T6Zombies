# Exfil
A script inspired by Cold Wars Exfil mechanic.

Every 5 rounds after round 10 you'll be able to exfil to end the game with a fun little challenge.
Exfil will be open for a limited time (similar to Cold Wars duration)

Once exfil has been initiated players will have to kill all the zombies and then head to the escape location. If you don't escape within the time frame you will die!

The exfil radio and location will be identified as a Revive icon, stay on a look out!

## Installation
Download exfil_sourcecode.gsc and put it in your Plutonium T6 scripts folder

```%localappdata%\Plutonium\storage\t6\scripts\zm\```

(if the folder isnt there create them)
